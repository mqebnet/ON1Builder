## Coding Guidelines

### Style Guide

- **PEP 8**: Follow the [Python Enhancement Proposal 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines.
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations for function signatures and variables.
- **Imports**: Organize imports using `isort` and group them logically.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 88 characters.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive and consistent naming for variables, functions, and classes.

### Commit Messages

- **Format**: Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

**Structure:**

```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```plaintext
feat(strategy): add new arbitrage strategy for Uniswap

Implement a new arbitrage strategy that detects price discrepancies between Uniswap and Sushiswap.
```

### Branching Model

- **Feature Branches**: Use `feature/feature-name` for new features.
- **Bug Fixes**: Use `fix/issue-number` for bug fixes.
- **Develop Branch**: Merge your feature branches into `develop`.
- **Main Branch**: Stable code ready for release.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for new code using `unittest` or `pytest`.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical components.

**Running Tests:**

```bash
pytest tests/
```

- **Continuous Integration**: Ensure your changes pass all CI checks.

## Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Include docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions using the Google style or reStructuredText.
- **README and Guides**: Update the `README.md` or other documentation files if your changes affect them.
- **Comments**: Write clear comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
